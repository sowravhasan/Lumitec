                <h2 class="pt-4">Solution : </h2>
                <h5>The solution has now been implemented, which includes a feature in both the contact and CRM systems that allows the meeting to be linked to the customer without automatically sending an email invitation.
This keeps the information on the client, but don’t send out any kind of invitation or reminders.</h5>

This process was time-consuming and often led to delays or errors, which could impact the success of the sales visit.</h5>
                    <h2 class="pt-4">Solution : </h2>
                     <h5>After installing the App, only with one-click they are able to see the address of the client.</h5>
                     <h5 class="py-4">When the sales representative opens the meeting information for a client, they simply need to click on the "Navigate to" button, which would open a new window in Google Maps or another GPS mapping application. This new window would automatically populate the client's address, eliminating the need for the sales representative to manually enter it into their GPS.
                        Once the address is populated, the sales representative can easily click on the "route planner" feature, which would provide them with turn-by-turn directions to the client's location. This streamlined process saved the sales representative time and reduced the risk of errors or delays.</h5>
